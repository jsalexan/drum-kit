  ## Description
  Project #1 from JavaScript30. A drum kit using vanilla JavaScript. 
  <br>

  This application uses the following technologies: JavaScript and CSS.
  <br><br>
  Grab the course at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)
  <br><br>
  In the future, I'd like to use some of the same techniques but adjust the sounds, images, and styling to make something really unique.
